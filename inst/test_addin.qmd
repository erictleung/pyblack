This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{python}
1    + 2

print(    "This is a text file"   )
x = {'a':    3, 'b'   : 4,
'c': 2, 'd': 200



}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

```{python}
1    + 2

print(    "This is a text file"   )
x = {'a':    3, 'b'   : 4,
'c': 2, 'd': 200



}
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{python}
1    + 2

print(    "This is a text file"   )
x = {'a':    3, 'b'   : 4,
'c': 2, 'd': 200



}
```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{python}
1    + 2

print(    "This is a text file"   )
x = {'a':    3, 'b'   : 4,
'c': 2, 'd': 200



}
```


```{python}
1    + 2

print(    "This is a text file"   )
x = {'a':    3, 'b'   : 4,
'c': 2, 'd': 200



}
```
